# Sanity Check Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Created a comprehensive sanity check system that analyzes proposals for common issues and provides actionable warnings. The system checks budget-scope alignment, timeline feasibility, and tech stack compatibility.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. State Schema Update (src/state.py)

Added new field:
```python
sanity_warnings: Optional[List[str]]
```

### 2. Sanity Check Node (src/nodes/sanity_check.py)

**Main Function:**
```python
def sanity_check_node(state: ProposalState) -> ProposalState
```

**Helper Functions:**
- `_extract_budget_number()` - Parse budget strings
- `_extract_timeline_months()` - Parse timeline strings
- `_check_budget_scope_mismatch()` - Detect budget issues
- `_check_timeline_reality()` - Detect timeline issues
- `_check_tech_stack_issues()` - Detect tech problems

### 3. Check Categories

#### A. Budget-Scope Mismatches

**1. Budget Too High for Scope**
- Condition: < 3 deliverables AND budget > $80k
- Example: 2 deliverables with $100k budget
- Action: Suggest breaking down or verifying expectations

**2. Budget Too Low for Scope**
- Condition: > 10 deliverables AND budget < $30k
- Example: 12 deliverables with $25k budget
- Action: Suggest increasing budget or reducing scope

**3. Budget-Hours Mismatch**
- Uses $100/hr as baseline
- Flags if budget is < 60% or > 150% of expected
- Examples:
  - 1000 hours (expects $100k) but budget is $30k → Insufficient
  - 100 hours (expects $10k) but budget is $150k → Too high

#### B. Timeline Reality Checks

**1. Aggressive Timelines**
- Condition: > 800 hours AND timeline < 2 months
- Calculates required developers (40 hrs/week assumption)
- Example: 1000 hours in 4 weeks needs 6x developers

**2. Overly Long Timelines**
- Condition: < 200 hours AND timeline > 6 months
- Example: 150 hours over 8 months

**3. General Mismatch**
- Timeline < 40% expected → Too aggressive
- Timeline > 250% expected → Too long

#### C. Tech Stack Issues

**Outdated Technologies Detected:**
```
Flash → HTML5, WebGL, modern web standards
jQuery → Vanilla JS, React, Vue, Angular
AngularJS → Modern Angular, React, Vue
Bower → npm, yarn
Grunt/Gulp → webpack, Vite
Backbone/Knockout → React, Vue, Angular
CoffeeScript → TypeScript, ES6+
PHP 5 → PHP 8+, Node.js
MySQL 5.5 → MySQL 8.0+, PostgreSQL
Python 2 → Python 3.10+
IE 11 → Modern browsers
```

**Conflicting Frameworks:**
- React + Angular (frontend)
- Django + Flask (Python)
- Express + Fastify (Node.js)
- MySQL + PostgreSQL (if both primary)

**Old Versions:**
- Node.js < 10 → 18+/20+
- React < 16 → 18+
- Angular < 12 → 15+
- Vue < 2 → 3+

## Example Warnings

### Budget Issue
```
⚠️ Budget Warning: Budget of $25,000 may be insufficient for 12 deliverables.
Each deliverable would average $2,083, which is typically too low for quality
implementation. Consider increasing budget or reducing scope.
```

### Timeline Issue
```
⚠️ Timeline Warning: 1000 hours would take ~6.2 months with 1 full-time developer,
but timeline suggests 1.0 months. This would require 6.2x developers working in
parallel, which may not be feasible for all tasks.
```

### Tech Stack Issue
```
⚠️ Tech Stack Warning: 'Jquery' is outdated/deprecated. Consider using
Vanilla JavaScript, React, Vue, or Angular (for UI interactivity) instead
for better performance, security, and maintainability.
```

### Multiple Issues
```
⚠️  Found 6 warning(s):

1. Budget may be insufficient for 12 deliverables
2. Budget-Hours Mismatch (needs ~$120k, provided $25k)
3. Timeline too aggressive (needs 7.5 months, provided 2 months)
4. Flash is outdated → Use HTML5
5. jQuery is outdated → Use modern frameworks
6. PHP 5 is outdated → Use PHP 8+
```

## How to Integrate

### Option 1: Add to Workflow (main.py)

```python
from nodes.sanity_check import sanity_check_node

# Add node
workflow.add_node("sanity_check", sanity_check_node)

# Add edges (after calculator, before generation)
workflow.add_edge("calculator", "sanity_check")
workflow.add_edge("sanity_check", "generation")
```

### Option 2: Use in Generation Node

```python
def generation_node(state: ProposalState) -> ProposalState:
    warnings = state.get('sanity_warnings')

    if warnings:
        warnings_section = "## Important Considerations\n\n"
        for warning in warnings:
            clean = warning.replace("⚠️", "").strip()
            warnings_section += f"- {clean}\n"

        # Include in proposal prompt
        prompt += f"\n{warnings_section}"

    # ... generate proposal
```

### Option 3: Display Separately

```python
# After running the workflow
result = graph.invoke(input)

if result.get('sanity_warnings'):
    print("\n⚠️  SANITY CHECK WARNINGS:")
    for warning in result['sanity_warnings']:
        print(f"  {warning}")
```

## Design Decisions

### Non-Blocking
- Never fails the pipeline
- Returns warnings, doesn't throw errors
- If sanity check fails, adds error as warning

### Context-Aware
- Uses user_input for tech detection
- Checks both tech_hints and user_input
- Understands various budget formats ($50k, $50,000, etc.)

### Actionable
- Every warning includes suggestion
- Clear explanation of the issue
- Specific alternatives for outdated tech

### Flexible
- Easy to adjust thresholds
- Simple to add new tech checks
- Can customize warning messages

## Customization

### Adjust Budget Thresholds
```python
# Line 120 in sanity_check.py
if num_deliverables < 3 and budget > 80000:  # Change here
if num_deliverables > 10 and budget < 30000:  # And here
```

### Adjust Timeline Thresholds
```python
# Line 185
if hours > 800 and timeline_months < 2:  # Change here
if hours < 200 and timeline_months > 6:  # And here
```

### Add New Outdated Tech
```python
# Line 219
outdated_tech = {
    'your_old_tech': 'modern_alternative',
    ...
}
```

### Add New Conflicting Pairs
```python
# Line 250
conflicting_pairs = [
    (['tech1'], ['tech2'], 'category name'),
    ...
]
```
